## Project Ideas for Ethereum Dapp

### DeFi

DF001: Create an application that delegates where assets should be distributed amongst a
community (DAO).
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Asset Tooling

### GameFi

GF001: Create factions/groups (mage, alchemist, swordsman, etc.) within your own personal
game for users to join.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: Create Factions

GF002: Randomize components of your game such as character customization (appearance and
specs). Your characters can also join certain faction or group at random. These
factions/groups can even be represented by a unique NFT!
Smart Modules: Random Pick, ERC721

GF003: Create games that rely entirely on chance (example: roulette and dice)
Smart Modules: Random Pick
DappStarter: Randomized Game

### DAO

DA001: Build sub-communities within a DAO. Get creative and add personalized art that
represents your creators, developers, admins or any other figure in your community!
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum)
DappStarter: DAO Tribes

DA002: Establish voting systems within a DAO. Important decision making can be more fun
throughan online interactive module.
Smart Modules: Tribes (Ethereum), ERC720, ERC721
DappStarter: DAO Voting

DA002: Establish an alternative voting system within a DAO where randomness replaces choice.
Smart Modules: Random Pick
DappStarter: DAO Random Voting

### Developing

DE001: Create developer teams to divide and conquer bounty hunting during hackathons.
Choose whether or not you and your friend want to help build the front-end application
or get started writing the smart contract code.
